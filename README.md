Air Traffic Forecasting Project

This repository contains the code for the Air Traffic Forecasting project. It aims to predict air traffic patterns using machine learning techniques. The project uses historical air traffic data and employs prophet forecasting model to predict future air traffic volumes accurately.


The repository includes the following elements:

* A notebook Malova_Tersou.ipynb containing the code to make predictions usning prophet
* The data we use
* The instructions for the project

Inside the airtraffic folder, go in the src folder to access the application (app.py)

[Code Files]: The source code files for the application are located in the code directory.
[Data File]: The dataset used by the application is available in the data directory.
[Requirements File]: The requirements.txt file lists the necessary Python packages and their versions required to run the application.
